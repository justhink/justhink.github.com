As i said in [Funds'R'us](http://al3xandr3.github.com/2008/02/12/funds-r-us.html), i think that in Xmas, Bday's, etc... we often end up offering gifts in a hurry that are not ideal(mostly waste) and part of the problem is because we don't know what to offer.

So, here's something i encourage everybody to do, share a *Wish List*!

### Big Stuff

Ok, but, sometimes grown up's want big stuff, like a car or a house, what to do then? Do a money contribution! Instead of buying that box of chocolates and pair of gloves, offer that exact same money value as a "contribution" for the house. Include a small card/note so you don't show up empty handed. Done.

## Al3xandr3 Wish List (2012)

Im into healthy food latelly, so anything related to that, is interesting, in particular:

- Any organic / naturally produced fruits and vegetables (also seeds, nuts, honey, nut butters).
- A high speed blender (probably nutribullet) - please do only small contributions
- The 4-Hour Chef book
