## How to Learn

### Deconstruction:
- Reduce content to its minimal moving parts (deconstruct, simplify, zoom out, distill).
- Start with the outcome; start at the end and work your way backwards
- Viewing the subject from a variety of perspectives 
- Walk from the end goal backwards, recursively asking "Why?"
- Looking at what successful outliers are doing 
- Probing the minds of experts through interviews
- Finding simple commonalities in a domain that can serve as a key to accelerate learning

### Selection: analyse and find the common features (80/20)
- Choose the 20% that covers the 80%
- The Minimal Effective Dose (MED): "The lowest volume, the lowest frequency, the fewest changes that get us our desired result."
- The what(material) is more important than the how(method)

### Sequencing: 
- Choose the right order to study / learn the material
- Make it stick first, start with fun and simple

### Stakes: 
- Loose something if miss it

### Compression: one-pager's cheat sheet
- The Prescriptive One-Pager lists rules or principles that help you generate real-world examples.
- The Practice One-Pager lists real-world examples to practice, which helps you learn the principles indirectly.

### Frequency: breaks / intensity(immersion) / expected progression
- Plan a study/practice schedule that provides the frequency needed to gain competency.

### Encoding: zip  / memorization tricks
- Find ways to associate the knowledge and skills with what you already know.

Also called space-repetition program. A practical way to do this is to create space-repetition decks and put them into a spaced repetition software, and just practice with the a few minutes every day.

### Do a Plan

Take into account the above rules of thumb to define a plan on how to tackle:

 - What to study
   - Look at the end goals and deconstruct - to define what to study
   - Select: apply 80/20 rule for selection and MED
   - Find ideal the material, interview Pro's
 
 - When to study it & Expected Outcomes
   - Look into the sequencing principles - organize an ideal "growth" sequence.
   - Define clear dates & outcomes for the sequence - applies the stakes principle.

 - During the study (and afterwards when practicing)
   - Summarize learnings in cheat-sheets, can be part of the expected outcomes - keep refining them
   - Potencially use memorization / encoding tricks if/when required

### Notes
- Explaining to others, forces to find clear explanations and interiorize the learnings
- Writting often helps thinking and developing subject further
- When learning be pro-activity, especially by asking many questions
