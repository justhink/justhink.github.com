intro: "Structured Presenting"

This documents, for my own reference, a training on how to do presentations.

## Communications rely on 3 questions
- What you want them to know ?
- What you want them to do ?
- How you want them to feel ? (emotional connection increases pontencial of message to stick)


## BodyLanguage

- Posture (Confident attitude):
  - Stern up (chest), even when sitting down 
- Legs (stable solid position):
  - Feet a shoulder apart (see Obama, James Bond, etc..), even when sitting down
  - Don't move around, moving is associated with fleeing, beware of that.
  - No strange positions and movements, bobby, bouncer, elvis knees (when sitting), etc...
- Arms:
  - BBC presenter hands.
  - Palms down - certainty, for sure, absolutely, decisive, conclusive. End of a negotiation.
  - Palms up - inviting, with possibility, typically an ask from audience.
- Tension:
  - Get a good balance of body tension, too much will became harsh (affects voice), too little does not look confident enough.
- Eye contact:
  - Constantly scan fully the room, make sure to get eye contact with everyone. People will start looking at the phones laptops without the constant eye contact.
  - Don't look too long same person.
 - Smile:
   - Depending on the message, but almost always good in general.

Everyone will be a bit different and need to work on their weak spots.



## Voice

- Pitch
 - Avoid monotone voice, try keep some variation in voice.
 - Low pitch associated with seriousness.
 - High pitch associated with excitement.
- Pace
 - slow = serious
 - fast = exciting
- Pause
 - Add pauses especially for serious stuff, creates a break in the rhythm, gets attention.
- Voice Projection (volume)
 - Strong in general is good
- Passion
 - Introduces feeling, that can augment the message trying to pass on, 
   - Makes others trust you fully believing the message you transmitting.





## Structured Presentations

### The Skeptical System

Works by answering tipical skeptical questions from audience, how expert presenter is in the matter (establishing credibility), whats in it for me, etc...

Break the presentation in a sequence of 4 parts, answering the "skeptical" audience questions:

- Why should i listen to you?
 - Credibility: i have many years of doing this ... Part of a specialized team, etc..
 - Context, history
- Whats in it for me ?
  - You will get: ...
- How does it work ?
  - Solution: By doing this ...
  - Number 3 facts (say 3 things, use fingers to enumerate, and last one is...)
  - Case studies if needed (good to introduce emotion, personal stories, real events)
- What now?
  - 1 specific easy to do action to do today, to get towards the goal
  - Thanks 2x: Thanks, let me know is there are questions, thanks.

To do the presentation, write a A4 paper separated into 4 areas, with the trigger words in each section, to guide the presentation.


### The Problem System

Another way of structuring a presentation.
This one is very often found in tv advertisement, even movies.
Works by starting with creating the problem, create the need to be resolved and then serving the solution.

- Problem
 - I would like to make you aware of a problem...
 - Somewhat taps into the fear natural system we have.
 - Even better when audience can relate to the problem as their own.
- What if (promise of problem solving)
  - What if i can tell you the problems identified before are all solvable
  - Problem addressing.
- Solution
 - The solution is ...
 - Because ... Enumerate 3 things. (say 3 things, use fingers to enumerate, say "and last one is")
- Action
  - Offer 2 options, 1 is the real one, then offer 1 less good, that makes the real one look better. Ex: You can either buy 2 with a discount, or 1 without discount.
  - Both options need to work in my favor. 
  - Thanks 2x: Thanks, let me know is there are questions, thanks.

  Again is enough to use an A4 paper divided in 4 with the trigger words, to guide the presentation.




## During presentation

- Anchoring:
  - Associate common gestures or expressions with anchors, of bad vs good, that can be used later on.
  - Energy balls. Left down is bad, right up is good. Presenter needs to mirror the audience, so presenter right=bad, left=good.
- Timeline: 
   - Hands moving left to right show timeline. Presenter needs to mirror audience.
- Big and small
  - Open including all audience means big things. (like the gain from the solution)
  - 2 pinched fingers (thumb and index finger), means small meaningless cost.

## Powerpoints

- The person is the central point of the presentation, not the powerpoint.
- Don't just read what on the slide. (otherwise can just email the slides).
- Use slides sequence as a storytelling structure.
- Less is more. Delete everything non essential.
- 3 main bullet points per slide max, brake down into 3 more sub-points if needed.
- Use images, covering the whole slide.
- Eye candy matters.



## Handling objections

- Empathize
 - I understand your problem
 - Avoid Buts: Yes... But... (don't go into defense mode !). But=Nevertheless="Don't you think that".
- Clarify
 - Tell me more (palms up)
 - Use open ended questions, let the person speak.
 - Gives some thinking time.
 - Could be useful to disarm it, by asking rest of people in room if have the same problem.
 - Avoid saying too soon: lets handle this after the meeting, only in last case scenario.
- Propose 
 - Best way is to offer a good solution.
 - So if we do this will it help ?
 - Offer a solution: if we guarantee this... if we send you an email with the options by end of week, etc...
-  Check
  - Check that the person has got their answer and is fine with proposed solution, don't move on without it. Even if someone else opens up more objections.
