Found some time ago the: http://www.webanalyticsdictionary.com/, which i like a lot as a source of web analytics definitions. 

There is no in-site search mechanism, which i found frustrating, but alternatively is possible to use google search:

    "Acknowledgement Page" site: www.webanalyticsdictionary.com

(as long as what you search for is already indexed by the google search engine)

Anyway, i decided to web scrape it for my own reference, and posting here if someone else finds it useful also.

( It could even be used to put on a memory repetition program like Anki, to help learning all the terms, or even for preparing for job interviews )

## Web Scraping it

### Step 1. Download the Internet to your computer (or, in this case, just the site)

    wget -m -p -E -k -K -np http://www.webanalyticsdictionary.com/

- "-m" mirror site.
- "-E" put .html on unrecognized files.
- "-k" convert the links in the document to make them suitable for local viewing.
- "-K" When converting a file, back up the original version with a ‘.orig’ suffix.
- "-np" Do not ever ascend to the parent directory when retrieving recursively.

### Step 2. Extract the data

Step one has made a local copy of the site. Now we need to extract the useful data from it:

    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
    import fnmatch
    import os
    import codecs

    results = {}

    for root, dirs, files in os.walk("."):
        for filename in fnmatch.filter(files, "index.html"):          
            f = open(os.path.join(root, filename), 'r')
            soup = BeautifulSoup(f.read())
            title = soup.select('.entry-title')
            content = soup.select('.entry-content')
            if title and content:        
                results[title[0].getText().strip()] = content[0].getText().encode('ascii', 'ignore').replace('\n', ' ')

    out = codecs.open('webanalyticsdictionary.csv', 'w', encoding='utf-8')
    for key, value in results.items():
        out.write(key + ", \"" + value + '\"\n')

I'm using the anaconda python all in one installation package to install both python and the libraries required.

## Web Analytics Dictionary

| **Keyword** | **What is** |
|:---------------|:---------------------------|
| % New Visits | Of all the visits to your site, what percentage of them came to your site for the first time. By itself, this is nearly useless. But, when paired with other stats it can be illuminating. For example, lets compare the number of new visitors to the number of page views. If your new visitor count is high and continues to grow, but your page views remains constant that would tell you that while you are attracting visitors, they are not coming back.  |
| (PIE) Persistent Identification Element | is a type of tag that is attached a users browser, providing a unique ID for that visitor. A PIE is not unlike a cookie. Though that kind of thinking will never assure your progress as a pastry chef.  |

| ACT | After-Click Tracking is the recording the activity path of a visitor to a site after they have clicked on an email link.  |
| action participation | Actions completed on any of the pages viewed during a visit. Whenever an action is completed on a target page, the action is counted for all pages viewed during the visit that contained the target page. Similarly, in case of document groups, action participation shows the number of actions completed on any of the pages of a document group. Whenever an action is completed on a target page, it is counted in all the document groups that contain the target page.  |
| action | Actions performed by your visitors. If your actions are set to unique, then the Action metric shows the number of unique actions (e.g., if a visitor makes three purchases during a visit, only one unique action is counted). Otherwise, the action metric shows the total number of (non-unique) actions (e.g., if an action occurs more than once during a visit, it will be counted every time it occurs). |
| Actionable Data | Information that allows you to make a decision or can be made use of in any way.  |
| Active Time / Engagement Time | Average amount of time that visitors spend actually interacting with content on a web page, based on mouse moves, clicks, hovers and scrolls.

| Advanced Analysis | Generic industry term relating to the advanced analysis of your web site traffic data. With regard to SiteCatalyst, it is the tab that contains advanced analysis features, including Data Warehouse, ASI, Discover, and Multivariate Testing.  |
| Advanced Analytics is suitable for | Websites with a lot of traffic, registration paths and diverse referrers and keywords.  |
| Advanced Segment Insight (ASI) | ASI stands for Advanced Segment Insight. This tool is used to segment data retrospectively from the Data Warehouse and create the new custom segment in a SiteCatalyst Report Suite.  |
| Advantages of logfile analysis | The main advantages of logfile analysis over page tagging are as follows:  The web server normally already produces logfiles, so the raw data is already available. No changes to the website are required. The data is on the companys own servers, and is in a standard, rather than a proprietary, format. This makes it easy for a company to switch programs later, use several different programs, and analyze historical data with a new program. Logfiles contain information on visits from search engine spiders, which generally do not execute JavaScript on a page and are therefore not recorded by page tagging. Although these should not be reported as part of the human activity, it is useful information forsearch engine optimization. Logfiles require no additionalDNSLookups. Thus there are no external server calls which can slow page load speeds, or result in uncounted page views. The web server reliably records every transaction it makes, including e.g. serving PDF documents and content generated by scripts, and does not rely on the visitors browsers co-operating   |
| Advantages of page tagging | The main advantages of page tagging over logfile analysis are as follows:  Counting is activated by opening the page (given that the web client runs the tag scripts), not requesting it from the server. If a page is cached, it will not be counted by the server. Cached pages can account for up to one-third of all pageviews. Not counting cached pages seriously skews many site metrics. It is for this reason server-based log analysis is not considered suitable for analysis of human activity on websites. Data is gathered via a component (tag) in the page, usually written in JavaScript, though Java can be used, and increasingly Flash is used. JQuery and AJAX can also be used in conjunction with a server-side scripting language (such asPHP) to manipulate and (usually) store it in a database, basically enabling complete control over how the data is represented.[dubiousdiscuss] The script may have access to additional information on the web client or on the user, not sent in the query, such as visitors screen sizes and the price of the goods they purchased. Page tagging can report on events which do not involve a request to the web server, such as interactions withinFlashmovies, partial form completion, mouse events such as onClick, onMouseOver, onFocus, onBlur etc. The page tagging service manages the process of assigning cookies to visitors; with logfile analysis, the server has to be configured to do this. Page tagging is available to companies who do not have access to their own web servers. Lately page tagging has become a standard in web analytics[4].  |

| All Search Engines | SiteCatalyst report that shows the traffic sent to you by both paid and natural search engines.  |
| Allocation | Allocation metrics are visit-based metrics in which the pages that visitors use result in success events, e.g. revenue or cart adds. For example, a visitor navigates through five pages of your site, and the visit results in a purchase of a $10,000 item. The allocation metric gives partial credit of the $10,000 to the five pages, so that each page receives $2,000 credit. If conversion is enabled, then allocation for pages is also automatically enabled. The linear allocation option for eVars follows this method. |
| Analogue Signal | A continuously-modulated waveform, such as that produced by a human voice or musical instrument. See alsoDigital Signal.  |
| Analysis techniques | There are different frameworks to get analytics working for you, like accessing the server logs and deciphering the information, packet sniffing which sniffs incoming and outgoing data packets and reads the visitor information, image based tagging which uses a query string and runs data collection scripts which analyses user requests sent to the servers. All these techniques are like double edged swords; they cut through useful visitor information and also cuts-off useful visitor information. This is why setting analytical goals is very important or rather the only option to achieve effectiveness. But do not worry; we do have some pretty decent tools from vendors, who understand the nuances better. Let us now look at some of the tools and options available, mostly commercial.  |

| Arbitrage | A practice through which web publishers  second tier search engines, directories and vertical search engines  engage in the buying and reselling of web traffic. Typically, arbitrage occurs when such publishers pool client budgets to engage in PPC campaigns on Tier I search engines (Google, Yahoo!, MSN). If the publishers pay $0.10 per click for traffic, they typically resell those visitors to clients who bid $0.20 or more for the same keywords. Successful arbitrage requires that the arbitrageur must pay less per click than what the traffic sells for. The variation called Affiliate Arbitrage involves a web site owner or blogger bidding on keywords from programs such as Yahoo! Search Marketing or Google AdWords, who then links the ads, either to their own web site, or directly to a merchant site displaying ads (from programs such as the Yahoo! Publisher Network or Google AdSense).  |

| Browser Cache (pronounced CASH)  | An application that provides a way to look at and interact with all the information on the World Wide Web (also called a Web browser). It is technically a client program (such as Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator) that uses Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to send requests to Web servers throughout the Internet on behalf of the user. A temporary storage location from which data can be retrieved. Data retrieval from cache is usually much faster than from the server. The Internet makes predominant use of the following two caching mechanisms: The Web browser stores recently downloaded pages in a temporary location on your hard drive. When you return to a page you've recently viewed, the browser quickly retrieves it from this local cache rather than the original server. You can usually change the size of your cache, depending on the browser you use. Most ISPs utilize caching servers on their network. When a browser requests a page, the page is downloaded to the individuals computer and also saved on the caching server. If a different user then requests the same page, it is then retrieved from one of the caching servers rather than the site servers. Many analysis tools (especially log file analyzers) fail to count page views from cached pages. SiteCatalysts proprietary cache-busting technology counts cached page views the same way it counts page views that have not been retrieved from cache, resulting in much more accurate Web site usage data. |

Large files, such as video clips, may be composed of millions of bytes (megabytes). Since website and server performance is heavily affected by the amount of bytes transferred, and web hosting providers often charge according to this measure, it is very important for site owners to be aware of and understand.

| Economic factors | Logfile analysis is almost always performed in-house. Page tagging can be performed in-house, but it is more often provided as a third-party service. The economic difference between these two models can also be a consideration for a company deciding which to purchase.  Logfile analysis typically involves a one-off software purchase; however, some vendors are introducing maximum annual page views with additional costs to process additional information. In addition to commercial offerings, several open-source logfile analysis tools are available free of charge. For Logfile analysis you have to store and archive your own data, which often grows very large quickly. Although the cost of hardware to do this is minimal, the overhead for an IT department can be considerable. For Logfile analysis you need to maintain the software, including updates and security patches. Complex page tagging vendors charge a monthly fee based on volume i.e. number of pageviews per month collected.  Which solution is cheaper to implement depends on the amount of technical expertise within the company, the vendor chosen, the amount of activity seen on the web sites, the depth and type of information sought, and the number of distinct web sites needing statistics. Regardless of the vendor solution or data collection method employed, the cost of web visitor analysis and interpretation should also be included. That is, the cost of turning raw data into actionable information. This can be from the use of third party consultants, the hiring of an experienced web analyst, or the training of a suitable in-house person. Acost-benefit analysiscan then be performed. For example, what revenue increase or cost savings can be gained by analysing the web visitor data?  |

Sites appear in organic (also called natural) results because a search engine has applied formulas (algorithms) to its search crawler index, combined with editorial decisions and content weighting, that it deems important enough inclusion without payment. Paid Inclusion Contentis also often considered organic even though it is paid advertising because paid inclusion content usually appears on SERPs mixed with unpaid, organic results.  |
| Organic Search Listings | Listings that search engines do not sell (unlike paid listings). Instead, sites appear solely because a search engine has deemed it editorially important for them to be included, regardless of payment. Paid Inclusion Contentis also often considered  |

(See http:// www.w3.org/P3P for more information.)  |
| P4P | Acronym for Pay for Performance, also designated as PFP. See alsoPPC Advertising.  |
| Packet Switching | The method used to move data around on TCP/IP networks. Data coming out of a machine is broken up into chunks, each chunk includes the address of where it came from, and where it is going. This enables chunks of data from many different sources to co-mingle on the same lines, and be sorted and directed to different routes by special machines along the way. This way many people can use the same lines at the same time.  |
| Page Depth / Page Views per Session | Page Depth is the average number of page views a visitor consumes before ending their session. It is calculated by dividing total number of page views by total number of sessions and is also called Page Views per Session or PV/Session.  |
| Page Duration |  Time spent by visitor on a web page.  |
| Page Impression | SeeImpression.  |
| Page Naming Tool | The Page Naming Tool may be used change page names as they appear in SiteCatalyst, or in other words, to give pages friendlier names. This tool allows you to change the displayed page name rather than the value of the pageName variable, which may improve the readability of your reports.  |
| Page Naming | Strategy Omniture uses during SiteCatalyst implementation to determine how a web page name will be displayed in SiteCatalyst reports, for example, the page URL can display (www.mysite.com) or a friendly name can display (Electronics).  |
| Page Not Found | The 404 or Not Found Error Message is an HTTP standard response code indicating that the client was able to communicate with the server, but the server either could not find the file that was requested, or was unwilling to fulfill the request for it and did not wish to reveal the reason why.  |
| Page page views per visit | Average number of pages viewed during a visit. Calculated by dividing the number of Page Views by the number of Visits.  |
| Page Summary | SiteCatalyst report that collects and organizes page-specific information about a single page and presents it in a single report.  |
| Page tagging | Concerns about the accuracy of logfile analysis in the presence of caching, and the desire to be able to perform web analytics as an outsourced service, led to the second data collection method, page tagging or Web bugs. In the mid 1990s,Web counterswere commonly seen  these were images included in a web page that showed the number of times the image had been requested, which was an estimate of the number of visits to that page. In the late 1990s this concept evolved to include a small invisible image instead of a visible one, and, by using JavaScript, to pass along with the image request certain information about the page and the visitor. This information can then be processed remotely by a web analytics company, and extensive statistics generated.The web analytics service also manages the process of assigning a cookie to the user, which can uniquely identify them during their visit and in subsequent visits. Cookie acceptance rates vary significantly between web sites and may affect the quality of data collected and reported.Collecting web site data using a third-party data collection server (or even an in-house data collection server) requires an additionalDNSlook-up by the users computer to determine the IP address of the collection server. On occasion, delays in completing a successful or failed DNS look-ups may result in data not being collected.With the increasing popularity ofAjax-based solutions, an alternative to the use of an invisible image, is to implement a call back to the server from the rendered page. In this case, when the page is rendered on the web browser, a piece of Ajax code would call back to the server and pass information about the client that can then be aggregated by a web analytics company. This is in some ways flawed by browser restrictions on the servers which can be contacted withXmlHttpRequestobjects. Also, this method can lead to slightly lower reported traffic levels, since the visitor may stop the page from loading in mid-response before the Ajax call is made.  |
| Page Tags |  Tags are JavaScript codes embedded in the web page to be executed by the browser. Tags are used to generate log files used by certain Web Analytics Tools.  |
| page title | The titles of your web pages as you have defined them. Yahoo! Web Analytics enables you to assign each web page a unique name for the purposes of reporting. If you do not define a page name, Yahoo! Web Analytics will use that pages HTML title tag in the reports.  |
| page URL | The URLs of your web pages.  |
| Page Value | SiteCatalyst report that shows you how much certain pages participated in generating revenue. For events, the Page Value Report uses allocationmetrics.  |
| Page View Duration / Time on Page | Average amount of time that visitors spend on each page of the site. As with Session Duration, this metric is complicated by the fact that analytics programs can not measure the length of the final page view unless they record a page close event.  |

| pageURL Variable | The pageURL variable overrides the actual URL of the page in cases where the URL of the page is not the URL that you would like reported in SiteCatalyst.  |
| Pageview |  A page is defined as any file or content delivered by a web server that would generally be considered a web document. This includes HTML pages (.html, .htm, .shtml), script-generated pages (.cgi, .asp, .cfm, etc.), and plain-text pages.

Only image files (.jpeg, .gif, .png), javascript (.js) and style sheets (.css) are excluded from this definition. Each time a file defined as a page is served, a pageview is registered by Google Analytics.  |
| Paid Inclusion | Refers to the process of paying a fee to a search engine in order to be included in that search engine or directory. Also known as guaranteed inclusion. Paid inclusion does not impact rankings of a web page; it merely guarantees that the web page itself will be included in the index. These programs were typically used by web sites that were not being fully crawled or were incapable of being crawled, due to dynamic URL structures, frames, etc.  |
| Paid Search Detection | SiteCatalyst utility that configures rules that SiteCatalyst can use to determine if specific search engines were paid (your company paid a fee for the search engine to list your site), and allows SiteCatalyst to identify the keywords that were used on a paid search engine. The marker is determined by the client; it must be in the query string, and is case-sensitive.  |
| Paid Search Keywords | Keywords that return high visibility search results in a search engine. The results are displayed at the top of the results or in a special report for paid keywords.  |
| Parameters | These are located in the URL immediately after a question mark and followed by an equal sign and a return value, known as name=value.  |
| Partial Shipment | A process in which a store ships / provides only some of the goods / services in a single order. Therefore, the PostAuth amount would be less than the amount of the approved PreAuth for the order.  |
| Participation | Participation metrics assign full revenue credit to each page used to generate the revenue. In the example above, the visitor navigates through five pages of your site, which results in a $10,000 purchase. The participation metric gives $10,000 credit to each page used in the purchase process. If any events have participation enabled, then the pages participating in the event also have participation enabled.  |

This directly reflects the behavior of most internet users; we are not challenging the use of mobiles for collecting serious information but merely suggesting upon the preferences of a user when looking for serious information. This behavior implies that the quality of browsing on the desktop platforms is higher compared to the mobile platform. The point here is the sustained focus of the user, which is more on desktops rather than mobiles.  |

| Time spending pattern | Users basically are inclined to spend more time browsing on their desktops or laptops rather than their fully loaded smart phone. This has more to do with the ergonomics. As mobile platforms are confined to various technical and physical limitations the behavior of users, while browsing, will be to use it shortly and timely and if they are in for some, time consuming activity, they would rather prefer to do it on their desktops which will strain them less.   |

| trackExternalLinks Variable | SiteCatalyst variable that enables linkInternalFilters and linkExternalFilters to determine whether any link clicked is an exit link.  |
| Tracking Code | The Google Analytics tracking code is a small snippet of code that is inserted into the body of an HTML page. When the HTML page is loaded, the tracking code contacts the Google Analytics server and logs a pageview for that page, as well as captures information about the visit and non-identifying information about the visitor.  |

| Traffic Variable | Custom Insight Traffic Variable (or prop) enables you to correlate custom data with specific traffic-related events. The prop variables are embedded in the SiteCatalyst code on each page of your website  |
| Traffic | On the web, traffic refers to the amount of data sent and received by visitors to a website.   |
| Transaction Unique Customer URL | Any process set by the Web site owner that begins with an order variable and ends with a success variable. This could mean a product purchase, newsletter signup or e-mail request for information after going through a preset process. A unique customer is registered when a person makes a purchase from your site for the first time within a specified period of time. In other words, while one person may buy from your site three times, this person would be recorded as one unique customer so you can tell exactly how many individual people are purchasing from your site. There are five different time frames SiteCatalyst uses to define unique customers: daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly. A daily unique customer may purchase from your site twice on February 7th, and then again on February 8th. This customer will register as two daily unique customers, because only the first purchase on the 7th and the purchase on the 8th would count as unique purchases for their respective days. This same standard is used to determine monthly and yearly unique customers for their respective time frames. It canbe helpful to ask the following question to see how SiteCatalyst determineswho is a unique customer: How many different people purchased from mysite during this time period? NOTE: The sum of all daily unique customers isnot equal to the total monthly unique customers for that month. This isbecause a customer who purchases twice in a given month will count as twodaily unique customers  one for each day they purchased  but only as asingle monthly unique customer. The same relationship holds true for monthlyunique customers and yearly unique customers. The method used to give anaddress to documents and other resources on the World Wide Web. The firstpart of a URL indicates what protocol to use, and the second part specifiesthe IP address or the domain name where the resource is located. Forexample, the first section of the URL http://www.Omniture.com specifies thatthe Web page that should be fetched using the HTTP protocol. The secondsection directs the main page in the Omniture domain to be retrieved.  |

| Unique IP Addresses | The number of unique IP addresses that visited the site in question during the given time frame. This is not to be confused with unique users. However, the count of unique IP addresses can serve as a lower bound for the number of unique users. IP addresses normally provide a fairly low count for unique users due to the fact that most mega proxies (AOL, MSN, ect) mask all of their users behind a single IP address and therefore appear as one user.  |
| Unique Users | An unduplicated count of all individually identified machines that made a visit to a selected domain during a given analysis period.  |
| Unique Visitor Session |  A Unique Visitor Session is a quantity of visitor interaction with a website for which the visitor can be tracked and declared with a high degree of confidence as being unique for the time period being analyzed.  |
| Unique Visitor | Unique visitors represent the number of unduplicated (counted only once) visitors to your website over the course of a specified time period. A unique visitor is determined with cookies.  |

| UV | Unique Visitors refers to a measure captured by some web analytics solutions that track the interaction a single user has with a website over time.  |
| Variable Truncation | Often refers to the shortening of a variable or an image request. If the number of characters in a variable or image request exceed the allowed number of characters, the characters exceeding the limit will be automatically removed, or truncated.  |
| Variable | Variables are contained in both the SiteCatalyst Code to Paste and the JavaScript file. Their primary purpose is to send values to SiteCatalyst and to control JavaScript execution.  |

There is no limit to the amount of data Sawmill can analyze, and even really huge datasets (gigabytes of log data) can be browsed in real time. Sawmill uses multiple levels of caching to ensure that once something has been computed, it will re-use the computation when possible, for highest performance.  |
| View Total |  The View Total is the tally of items currently shown in the report. This total does not include items that are not shown.

| Visit | A page request or a series of page requests by a visitor to a given domain. If, after the initial page request occurs and 30 minutes elapses without a subsequent page request, the visit session is closed. A new visit session is opened upon the next page request to the given domain.  |
| Visit-based Cookies | The visit-based (or session) cookie is a type of persistent cookie, but it offers an additional level of security over the basic persistent cookie because the visit-based cookie is deleted when your session ends.  |
| Visitor / Unique Visitor / Unique User | The uniquely identified client generating requests on the web server (log analysis) or viewing pages (page tagging) within a defined time period (i.e. day, week or month). A Unique Visitor counts once within the timescale. A visitor can make multiple visits. Identification is made to the visitors computer, not the person, usually via cookie and/or IP+User Agent. Thus the same person visiting from two different computers will count as two Unique Visitors. Increasingly visitors are uniquely identified by Flash LSOs (Long Storage Objects), which are less susceptible to privacy enforcement. % Exit:The percentage of users who exit from a page. - end official glossary- There are some bits of jargon outside the more official terms that you may encounter and find handy to know  |

| Web analytics | is the measurement, collection, analysis and reporting ofinternet datafor purposes of understanding and optimizing web usage.[1] Web analytics is not just a tool for measuring website traffic but can be used as a tool for business research and market research. Web analytics applications can also help companies measure the results of traditional print advertising campaigns. It helps one to estimate how traffic to a website changes after the launch of a new advertising campaign. Web analytics provides information about the number of visitors to a website and the number of page views. It helps gauge traffic and popularity trends which is useful for market research. There are two categories of web analytics;off-siteandon-siteweb analytics.Off-site web analytics refers to web measurement and analysis regardless of whether you own or maintain a website. It includes the measurement of a websitespotentialaudience (opportunity), share of voice (visibility), and buzz (comments) that is happening on the Internet as a whole.On-site web analytics measure a visitors journey onceon your website. This includes its drivers and conversions; for example, whichlanding pagesencourage people to make a purchase. On-site web analytics measures the performance of your website in a commercial context. This data is typically compared againstkey performance indicatorsfor performance, and used to improve a web site or marketing campaigns audience response.Historically, web analytics has referred to on-site visitor measurement. However in recent years this has blurred, mainly because vendors are producing tools that span both categories.  |
| Web Analytics | The measurement of data as it relates to an Internet site, including the behavior of visitors, the amount of traffic, the conversion rates, web server performance, user experience, and other information in order to understand and proof of results and continually improve the results of a site towards a set of objectives.  |
| Web Beacon | A web beacon, also known as a clear.gif, is a transparent graphic image, no larger than 11 pixel, usually placed on a web site or in an email to track visitor behavior. SiteCatalysts web beacon points to a server, known as 2o7.net, to retrieve the image. The image, when loaded into the users browser, loads JavaScript code that performs several functions, one of which is to check for a cookie. If a cookie is not loaded, it loads one on the browser. If the user does not have cookies enabled, a web beacon will not be able to track the users activity. The web beacon for a non-cookied user will account for an anonymous visit, but the users unique information will not be recorded. The JavaScript code also collects variables (particular to the selected web site) from the code and sends them back to SiteCatalyst.  |
| Web Elements | Google product that lets you copy and paste code for displaying Google products, such as Custom Search and Google Calendar onto your own website. To learn more and see which Google products have a Web Element, see theWeb Elementssite.  |
| Web server logfile analysis | Web servers record some of their transactions in a logfile. It was soon realized that these logfiles could be read by a program to provide data on the popularity of the website. Thus aroseweb log analysis software. In the early 1990s, web site statistics consisted primarily of counting the number of client requests (orhits) made to the web server. This was a reasonable method initially, since each web site often consisted of a single HTML file. However, with the introduction of images in HTML, and web sites that spanned multiple HTML files, this count became less useful. The first true commercial Log Analyzer was released by IPRO in 1994[2]. Two units of measure were introduced in the mid 1990s to gauge more accurately the amount of human activity on web servers. These werepage viewsandvisits(orsessions). Apage viewwas defined as a request made to the web server for a page, as opposed to a graphic, while avisitwas defined as a sequence of requests from a uniquely identified client that expired after a certain amount of inactivity, usually 30 minutes. The page views and visits are still commonly displayed metrics, but are now considered rather rudimentary.The emergence ofsearch engine spidersand robots in the late 1990s, along withweb proxiesanddynamically assigned IP addressesfor large companies andISPs, made it more difficult to identify unique human visitors to a website. Log analyzers responded by tracking visits bycookies, and by ignoring requests from known spiders.The extensive use ofweb cachesalso presented a problem for logfile analysis. If a person revisits a page, the second request will often be retrieved from the browsers cache, and so no request will be received by the web server. This means that the persons path through the site is lost. Caching can be defeated by configuring the web server, but this can result in degraded performance for the visitor to the website.  |
| Web Server |  This is a vague term whose meaning must be determined by the context in which its used. It will mean one of two things: The physical computer that acts as a server.
